This post represents lot of firsts for me, my first personal portfolio and blog website, my first post on said blog website and my first real cybersecurity certification. As the keen eyed of you may have already noticed, I passed the certificate a week ago but withheld announcing it for I wanted to make this website along with it...when it rains it pours amiright?

Why? Mainly because I wanted to give readers more than just an announcement of this achievement, by way of sharing my personal notes that I took during the course even if it were to benefit just one person, I'd say it was well worth the effort.

I﻿ didn't think every module in every course of the certification was worth taking notes on so I've only jotted down the things I believe would be useful, interesting or worth knowing to the readers. Let's go through it together, shall we?

#### C﻿ISSP Domains

The CISSP Domains represent the core of the cybersecurity industry, each of the seven domains representing their own vast array of roles.

1. **Security and Risk Management:** Establishing goals, ensuring compliance, mitigating risks, and planning for business continuity.
2. **Asset Security:** Protecting digital and physical assets by managing data storage, retention, disposal, and controlling access.
3. **Security Architecture and Engineering:** Designing and maintaining effective security systems and tools to safeguard data.
4. **Communications and Network Security:** Securing and managing physical and network infrastructures.
5. **Identity and Access Management:** Controlling access through identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability, following the principle of least privilege.
6. **Security Assessment and Testing:** Conducting audits and vulnerability assessments to identify risks and improve security controls.
7. **Security Operations:** Investigating incidents and implementing preventive measures to respond to breaches effectively.
8. **Software Development Security:** Applying secure coding standards and rigorous testing, including design reviews and penetration testing, to ensure application security.

#### Threats, Risks and Vulnerabilities

A *﻿*Threat** is anything or anyone or essentially any circumstance that can negatively impact your assets.

A **Vulnerability** is something that a threat could use to carry out harm on an asset.

When there is hence a presence of a vulnerability and a risk in conjunction, we can therefore say that there is a **Risk** present to the CIA triad of our asset.

#### NIST Risk Management Framework

Something I really enjoyed about the Google Cybersecurity Certificate was the dwelving into different frameworks, I've felt like this is something that is unfortunately glossed over when talking
